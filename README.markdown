# CSS Project

Mobile-first/only, 370px-wide screen.

Use fonts that are similar â€“ they don't have to match exactly, but be consistent: If you use "Georgia" to replace a certain font on the website, use "Georgia" for all occurrences of that font. That is, the number of different fonts you use should be the same as the number of different fonts used in the comps.

This should be quick-ish. Use the assets (in the "part1" folder) instead of trying to figure out how to do such complex CSS styling (e.g. it's pretty much impossible to make those trees and the lake using CSS).

Consider working on a good template for this first:

You aren't being given any assets for this. Figure out a way to implement it on your own. It might look straightforward (And maybe it is), but it might complicate things that **only the sign with the word "Register" on it should be clickable**.
